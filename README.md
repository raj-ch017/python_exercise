Python is today’s fastest growing programming language. This engaging and refreshingly
different guide breaks down the skills into clear step-by-step chunks and explains the theory using brief easy-to-understand language. 

Rather than bamboozling readers with pages of mind-numbing technical jargon, this book includes 150 practical challenges, putting
the power in the reader’s hands. Through creating programs to solve these challenges the
reader will quickly progress from mastering the basics to confidently using subroutines,
a graphical user interface, and linking to external text, csv and SQL files.
